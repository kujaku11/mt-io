# mt-io

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mt-io.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mt-io)

**Version**: 0.0.3

This package is meant to be a repository for readers for various magnetotelluric data file types from various data loggers including:

| Data Logger | File Type | Reader | Maturity |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| LEMI 424 | txt | Y | medium |
| LEMI 423 | B423 | Y | medium |
| LEMI 417 | ? | In progress | weak | 
| Metronix | atss| Y | medium |
| Metronix | ats | In progress | weak |
| MiniSEED | mseed | Y | strong |
| NIMS | bin | Y | strong |
| Phoenix MTU-5C | td_*, JSON, bin | Y | medium |
| Phoenix MTU-5A | tbl* | Y | medium |
| UoA PR6-24 | BX, BY, BZ, EX, EY | Y | medium |
| UoA Orange | binary | Y | medium |
| USGS ASCII | ascii | Y | medium |
| ZEN | z3d | Y | strong |

This package will read the data into either a `mt_timeseries.ChannelTS` or a `mt_timeseries.RunTS` object depending on the data included in the file.

## Newer Readers

Recent additions include newer LEMI and University of Adelaide readers:

- `mt_io.lemi.read_lemi423` for LEMI-423 `B423` files
- `mt_io.lemi.read_lemi424` for LEMI-424 ASCII text files
- `mt_io.uoa.read_uoa` for PR6-24 Earth Data Logger channel files
- `mt_io.uoa.read_orange` for legacy Orange Box binary files

These readers return `mt_timeseries.RunTS` objects and are covered by the current test suite.
